R-QNT (Rama-Quantum Network Torsion) Theory Summary:
- Spacetime is a 3D elastic network of fields A, B, and C.
- Vacuum is A+B+C=0 (flat).
- Matter: Topological knots (Borromean links) in the network.
- Charge: Geometric chirality (Right-handed = Positive, Left-handed = Negative).
- Gravity: Restorative tension from "string consumption" in knots.
- R-QNT-C: c is constant, relativity emerges effectively.
- R-QNT-V: c varies with local network stiffness k (c_local = c0 * sqrt(k0/k_local)).
- Neutron: A proton knot neutralized by counter-torsion impact.
